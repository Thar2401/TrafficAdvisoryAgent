# 🚦 AI-Based Traffic Advisory Agent

A comprehensive intelligent system for urban traffic management and route optimization, designed to support **UN SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** through data-driven transportation solutions.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **AI-Based Traffic Advisory Agent** leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide real-time traffic insights, route optimization, and sustainable transportation recommendations.

The system is built using an **agentic workflow architecture**, where decision-making is broken into four intelligent modules:

- 🔍 **Perception Module** – Data ingestion and preprocessing  
- 🧠 **Reasoning Module** – Traffic pattern analysis and prediction  
- ⚡ **Decision Module** – Multi-criteria route optimization  
- 📋 **Action Module** – Recommendation generation and presentation
